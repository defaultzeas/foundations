            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy enough to handle total saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However, in a pinch, any thick-sliced white bread will do. </p>
            <p>French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <li>⅔ cup milk</li>

                <li>salt to taste </li>
                <li>6 thick slices bread </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed </li>
            </ul>
